\section*{Abstract}
Vault Runner is a compact educational language for controlling a robot (Runner) in a 2D grid vault. It emphasizes clear control flow, sensor-driven decisions, and a strict alphabet constraint (\(\leq\) 20 distinct tokens). This report presents the language specification, examples with token counts, and a reflection on design trade-offs under the assignment constraints. A reference interpreter, a CLI, an interactive game (terminal and GUI), and optional extensions are implemented in Python.

\section{Language Specification}
\subsection{Purpose}
Teach core programming concepts (sequencing, conditionals, loops, state) in a constrained, visually grounded environment. Programs should be readable by beginners and map directly to robot actions.

\subsection{Token Set (Core, \(\leq\) 20)}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Movement: \texttt{MOVE}, \texttt{LEFT}, \texttt{RIGHT}, \texttt{RTURN}
  \item Actions: \texttt{PICK}, \texttt{OPEN}
  \item Control Flow: \texttt{LOOP} \textit{n}, \texttt{IF} \textit{sensor}, \texttt{WHILE} \textit{sensor}, \texttt{END}
  \item Sensors: \texttt{FRONT}, \texttt{KEY}, \texttt{DOOR}, \texttt{EXIT}
  \item State: \texttt{SET}, \texttt{CLR}
\end{itemize}
Total distinct core tokens: \textbf{16} (under the 20-token limit). Single integer literals are allowed for \texttt{LOOP n}. Comments start with \texttt{\#} until end of line.

\paragraph{Optional Extensions (not part of the core 16):} \texttt{WAIT}, \texttt{MARK}, \texttt{GOTO}, \texttt{SCAN}, \texttt{COUNT}, \texttt{SAVE}, \texttt{LOAD}. When used, the extended interpreter is auto-selected.

\subsection{Grammar (Informal)}
\begin{verbatim}
Program    ::= Stmt*
Stmt       ::= MOVE | LEFT | RIGHT | RTURN | PICK | OPEN
            |  LOOP Number Stmt* END
            |  IF Sensor Stmt* END
            |  WHILE Sensor Stmt* END
            |  SET | CLR
Sensor     ::= FRONT | KEY | DOOR | EXIT
Number     ::= Non-negative integer (base 10)
Comment    ::= '#' <any until end-of-line>
\end{verbatim}

Indentation in examples is for readability only; the interpreter is whitespace-insensitive beyond token separation.

\subsection{Semantics}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \textbf{MOVE}: advance one tile if not blocked by a wall.
  \item \textbf{LEFT}/\textbf{RIGHT}: rotate 90° counter/clockwise. \textbf{RTURN}: randomly turn left or right.
  \item \textbf{PICK}: pick up a key when on a key tile (core). In the extension challenge, only the designated correct key opens the door.
  \item \textbf{OPEN}: open a door if at door and carrying the (correct) key; the door becomes passable.
  \item \textbf{IF}/\textbf{WHILE}: evaluate the given sensor (\texttt{FRONT}, \texttt{KEY}, \texttt{DOOR}, \texttt{EXIT}) at the start of the block/iteration.
  \item \textbf{LOOP n}: execute the block exactly \textit{n} times (no loop variable).
  \item \textbf{SET}/\textbf{CLR}: manipulate a single boolean flag (the only internal state beyond the world and position). This fulfills the assignment constraint of "only literals, a single accumulator/flag" - meaning no variables, only direct values (numbers, keywords, sensors) and one piece of memory that can be True or False. The base interpreter exposes the flag for future strategies; examples do not require it.
  \item \textbf{Escape}: success occurs when the robot reaches an \texttt{EXIT} tile, or passes through an opened \texttt{DOOR}. In the Extension Challenge, success is restricted to escaping \emph{through the door} after picking the correct key.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Model}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Invalid token: \texttt{SyntaxError("Invalid token 'X' on line k")}
  \item Too many distinct tokens: \texttt{SyntaxError("Too many distinct tokens: m (max 20 allowed)")}
  \item Unmatched control: \texttt{SyntaxError("Unmatched LOOP/IF/WHILE - missing END")}.
  \item Runtime protection: maximum-instruction safety limit to halt infinite loops.
\end{itemize}

\section{Examples and Algorithms}
Token counts reflect distinct core tokens used per program (\(\leq\) 20).

\subsection{Minimal Program}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=vault,caption={Move and attempt to pick a key}]
MOVE
IF KEY
  PICK
END
RIGHT
MOVE
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Distinct tokens:} \{MOVE, IF, KEY, PICK, END, RIGHT\} = 6.

\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Distinct tokens:} \{LOOP, IF, EXIT, CLR, END, KEY, PICK, DOOR, OPEN, FRONT, MOVE, RIGHT\} = 12.
\textbf{Algorithm:} BFS-inspired systematic exploration. The robot explores the room systematically, collecting keys and attempting to open doors, with exit detection as the highest priority.

    IF FRONT
      MOVE
      CLR
    END
  END
  IF FRONT
    MOVE
  END
  RIGHT
END
\end{lstlisting}
\textbf{Distinct tokens:} \{LOOP, IF, EXIT, CLR, END, KEY, PICK, DOOR, OPEN, FRONT, MOVE, RIGHT\} = 12.
\textbf{Algorithm:} Three-phase BFS with 2000 total iterations. The robot systematically explores the environment, collecting keys and testing doors, with exit detection as the highest priority. Success requires escaping through the door after obtaining the correct key.

\section{Implementation and Results}
\subsection{System Architecture}
The Vault Runner implementation consists of several key components:

\section{Reflection (\textit{300--500 words})}
Designing Vault Runner under the assignment's constraints centered on simplicity, clarity, and enforceable limits. The most influential constraint was the 20-token alphabet. We selected 16 core tokens that cover locomotion, interaction, sensing, and control flow. The set avoids syntactic sugar and higher-level constructs that would add power at the cost of learnability or token budget. For example, we chose a \texttt{LOOP n} without a loop variable rather than a general \texttt{for}-loop, since the pedagogical goal is to practice repetition rather than iteration over data structures.

Restricting state to a single boolean flag shaped both the interpreter and example programs. Many navigation problems are solvable with reactive sensor logic (\texttt{WHILE FRONT} / \texttt{IF KEY}) and do not require complex memory. The presence of \texttt{SET}/\texttt{CLR} keeps the door open to strategies like "remember that I saw a door" while preventing uncontrolled state growth. In practice, most beginner-friendly solutions did not need the flag; its main role is to demonstrate the minimal notion of state in the language and to support extensions.

We adopted block-structured control with mandatory \texttt{END}, which simplifies parsing and nesting. This enabled an interpreter architecture with tokenization, a program counter, and a small call stack for matching blocks—close to the supplement's simple interpreter loop while robust enough to deliver helpful syntax errors (invalid tokens, unmatched blocks, token-limit violations). Comments (\texttt{\#}) were added to improve readability without impacting the token budget.

Semantics are intentionally concrete: movement and sensing map 1:1 to the robot API. This directness shortens the distance from code to behavior and makes step-by-step visualization meaningful in both the terminal and GUI. The environment model (rectangular room with walls; floor, key, door, exit) reflects the brief and ensures that simple strategies remain effective. A key design nuance is that the assignment permits exiting via an \texttt{EXIT} tile as a valid shortcut. Our implementation respects this globally, but the Extension Challenge explicitly requires escaping \emph{through the door} after obtaining the correct key. This variation emphasizes goal conditioning and validates the optional special-key rule in an authentic task.

The implementation presented several technical challenges. The GUI required careful coordinate system management (logical bottom-left origin vs. visual top-left origin) and non-blocking execution using Qt threads. The Extension Challenge's complexity demanded sophisticated algorithms while maintaining the language's simplicity. We implemented BFS-inspired exploration with multiple phases, achieving reasonable success rates without compromising the core language design. Error handling and token limit enforcement required careful integration throughout the interpreter pipeline.

Finally, we balanced minimalism with extensibility. Optional extended commands (e.g., \texttt{MARK}/\texttt{GOTO}, \texttt{WAIT}, \texttt{SAVE}/\texttt{LOAD}) are isolated from the core. Programs that use extensions are automatically routed to the extended interpreter; core programs remain within the 16-token budget and the simpler semantics. This separation preserves the spirit of the constraints while showcasing how a compact core can scale to richer problem-solving when appropriate. Overall, the constraints led to a concise, teachable language with a clear execution model and strong alignment between specification, implementation, and pedagogy.
