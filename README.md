# Vault Runner Programming Language

A simple programming language for controlling a robot in a 2D vault environment. The robot can navigate through corridors and rooms, pick up keys, open doors, and find exits. This project includes an interactive game, language extensions, and comprehensive testing.

##  Features

- **Core Language**: Simple, constraint-based programming language (max 20 distinct tokens)
- **Interactive Game**: Play challenges and learn programming concepts
- **Language Extensions**: Advanced commands for complex scenarios
- **Visual Simulation**: Real-time robot movement visualization
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with benchmarks

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

##  Language Features

### Core Commands
- **Movement**: `MOVE`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `RTURN`
- **Actions**: `PICK`, `OPEN`
- **Control Flow**: `LOOP <n>`, `IF <sensor>`, `WHILE <sensor>`, `END`
- **Sensors**: `FRONT`, `KEY`, `DOOR`, `EXIT`
- **State Management**: `SET`, `CLR`

### Extended Commands (Optional)
- **Timing**: `WAIT <n>` - Pause execution
