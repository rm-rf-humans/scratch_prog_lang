# Vault Runner Language Extension

Transform Vault Runner into a command-line programming language that works just like Python!

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm-rf-humans/scratch_prog_lang/main/install.sh | bash
```

## 📝 Usage

### Execute .sc files directly:
```bash
vault-runner my_program.sc
vault-runner my_program.sc -v  # Verbose output
```

### Interactive modes:
```bash
vault-runner -i    # Interactive demo
vault-runner -g    # Play the game
vault-runner -e    # Try extensions
vault-runner -d    # Run demo
```

## 🏗️ Writing Programs

Create a `.sc` file with your Vault Runner program:

```sc
# hello.sc
MOVE
MOVE
IF KEY
    PICK
END
LEFT
MOVE
```

Then execute it:
```bash
vault-runner hello.sc
```
